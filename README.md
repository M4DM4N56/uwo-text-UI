This is a Western University project.

The files written by me are :

    Key
    Record
    BSTNode
    BinarySearchTree
    BSTDictionary
    Interface

This project is a text-based user interface that opens different file types, filters, and sorts files.

This program makes use of, and implements the Binary Search Tree Dictionary ADT.
